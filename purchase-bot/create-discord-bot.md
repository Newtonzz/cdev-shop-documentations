### Verbatim

{% hint style="danger" %}
* In order to fully activate the bot, enabling **all intents** are required.
* Bot profile, bio, username, etc. is all customizable by you.
* Bot token is dangerous. Take care of it. **Don't share it with anyone, aside cDev team.**
* Your bot will be offline if you are about to reset the token.
* Our system are based on guild ID. Enabling **Public Bot** and use it for any purposes beside private usage wouldn't work.
