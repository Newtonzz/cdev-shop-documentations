<details>

<summary>The bot didn't work, it's scan but it won't delete?</summary>

This is the most asked questions on our support server, and we're prepared here. Please check few conditions below.

## Permissions

Check if the bot has permissions to delete and check messages in the current channel.

## Monitor

Check if the channel is monitored, by using `/settings watch` command.

## Probability

Try to adjust the probability somewhere in 60-80% with `/settings probability`.

You can try testing it by enabling preview mode, or using `/settings analyze` to see what's work the best for you.

## Multiple identities

Yes, we have another [competitor](https://top.gg/bot/706054368318980138), which often confused by the name.

Make sure if you're using the right bot.

## Inaccuracy, final fixed.

Maybe our models doesn't catch that. Feel free to submit us the content, so we can look and retrain our models, if possible.

Our service is not a foolproof, which means you still need a human moderation in the middle.

<summary>What is model?</summary>

Model is a system, or process that is used to make predictions or decisions based on input data.

We have two models in our sides, Anti-NSFW and NSFWJS.

Both models have slight inaccuracies, but it's enough for daily basis chat moderation.

We'd prefer NSFWJS for deep, slow conversation. And, Anti-NSFW for a fast-paced environment.
