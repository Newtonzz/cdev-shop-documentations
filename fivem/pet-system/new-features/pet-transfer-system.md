**Perfect for:**

* 🐾 Secure pet ownership transfers with validations

* If `PetTransfer.enable = false`, you'll see **"Pet transfer is currently disabled!"** notification
* Command fails gracefully with no menu opening

**2️⃣ Pet Ownership Check**

* Server fetches all pets owned by you from database
* If you have **no pets**, you'll see **"You have no pets to transfer"** notification
* If you have pets, menu proceeds to open

**3️⃣ Menu Opens**

* Interactive menu appears showing all your pets
* Each pet displays:
  * **Pet Name** and **ID**
  * **Model/Breed** information
  * **K9 Status** (Yes/No indicator)

When you click **Confirm Transfer**:

* Checks if recipient has no active pets
* If fee is set, sends confirmation request to recipient
* You see **"Waiting for target player to confirm transfer and fee..."** notification

**6️⃣ Recipient Confirmation (If fee is enabled)**

Recipient receives a popup with:

* Sender's name
* Pet name being transferred
* Fee amount
* **Accept** or **Decline** buttons

**7️⃣ Transfer Completion**

#### How It Works

| Step                               | Description                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ **Set Transfer Fee**           | Sender inputs a fee amount within configured minimum and maximum bounds.         |
| 2️⃣ **Recipient Prompt**           | Recipient receives a detailed prompt including sender’s name, pet info, and fee. |
| 3️⃣ **Approval Required**          | Recipient must accept or decline the fee to proceed.                             |
| 4️⃣ **Funds Check & Transaction**  | System verifies recipient's funds and processes payment if approved.             |
| 5️⃣ **Completion or Cancellation** | Transfer completes on success; otherwise, appropriate notifications are sent.    |

#### Configuration Options

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to set these values in your configuration file:
{% endhint %}

| Option         | Description                      | Example |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- |
| `enableCharge` | Enable or disable the fee system | `true`  |
| `minCharge`    | Minimum allowed fee amount       | `50`    |
| `maxCharge`    | Maximum allowed fee amount       | `1000`  |

***

#### Important Notes

* 🧾 The **recipient pays the fee**, not the sender.
* ⚠️ Transfers only complete after **recipient’s explicit acceptance**.
* ⛔ Fees outside min/max trigger validations and rejection.
* 🔒 All fee validations happen **server-side** to prevent abuse.
* 📜 Full transaction and transfer logs are posted to Discord for audit.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure player notifications clearly indicate the fee amount and actions required to avoid confusion.

#### Permission Configuration

    -- ==========================================
    -- 🔄 PET TRANSFER SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
    -- ==========================================
    --
    -- 🐕 OVERVIEW:
    -- The Pet Transfer system allows players to transfer their pets (including all stats and inventory)
    -- to another player. Optionally, the feature can be fully disabled or you can require the new owner
    -- to pay a transfer fee (with confirmation).

    PetTransfer = {
        -- 🔘 Master toggle: Set to 'false' to completely disable pet transfers (players will not see the transfer option in pet menu)
        enable = true,

        -- 💸 Enable/Disable charging a fee for transferring pets
        -- If 'false', no fee required or confirmation for the receiving player; transfer is instant.
        -- If 'true', transferring player will enter a transfer amount, and the receiver must accept the charge and have enough money.
        enableCharge = true,

        -- 💵 Minimum and maximum fee allowed when charging is enabled
        -- (Prevents typos, very low/high charges, and can be used for default server economy balancing)
        minCharge = 0,      -- Smallest amount player must charge (default: 0 = free allowed)
        maxCharge = 200000, -- Highest amount allowed for a transfer (default: 50000)
