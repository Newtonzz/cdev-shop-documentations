# 🐩 Pet Place Preview

## &#x20;🐩Pet Palce Preview <a href="#pet-transfer-system" id="pet-transfer-system"></a>

{% hint style="success" %}
**NEW FEATURE!** This feature is fully compatible with existing shops. Old shops will maintain their pet placed by default.
{% endhint %}

### 📋 Overview

The Pet Preview feature lets you place a pet in the shop gallery for display only. From the management panel inventory, the manager can choose Place (pet is buyable via target/drawtext) or Place Preview (pet is visible but cannot be bought). Ideal for showcases, display-only models, or shops that want to show pets without selling them at that spot.

**Perfect for:**

*   Controlling which pets in the gallery can be bought and which are display-only


* Creating showcases and display areas without selling the displayed model
* Keeping the shop organized (preview vs for sale)
*   Improving role-play with decorative or demo pets
