### ⚠️ Troubleshooting

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Common Issues and Solutions**
{% endhint %}

#### Menu Won't Open

**Problem:** Typing `/petmanager` does nothing

**Solutions:**

1. ✅ Check you have `PermPetManager` permission in config
2. ✅ Verify your admin/god/ ace command permission is active
3. ✅ Restart cdev\_pets: `restart cdev_pets`
4. ✅ Check F8 console for errors
5. ✅ Reconnect to server

***

#### No Pets Showing

**Problem:** Menu opens but "All Pets" shows 0 pets

**Solutions:**

1. ✅ Check if any pets exist in database
2. ✅ Verify `cdev_pets` table exists
3. ✅ Check database connection (other resources working?)
4. ✅ Restart both cdev\_pets and cdev\_lib
5. ✅ Check server console for SQL errors

**Verify Database:**

SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM cdev\_pets;

**If returns 0:** No pets in database (this is normal if no players have pets yet)

**If returns NULL/error:** Database table missing or corrupted

***

#### Delete Doesn't Work

**Problem:** Click "Delete Pet" but pet still exists

**Solutions:**

1. ✅ Check confirmation dialog appeared
2. ✅ Verify you clicked "Okay" (not "Cancel")
3. ✅ Check server console for errors
4. ✅ Refresh Pet Manager (close and reopen)
5. ✅ Check database directly

**Verify Deletion in Database:**

SELECT \* FROM cdev\_pets WHERE id = \[pet\_id];

**If pet still exists:**

* Check server console for SQL error
* Verify database permissions
* Check if pet is spawned (might need despawn first)

***

#### Menu Doesn't Refresh

**Problem:** After deleting pet, menu still shows it

**Solution:** Menu **automatically refreshes** after deletion.

**If it doesn't:**

1. ✅ Wait 1-2 seconds (slight delay)
2. ✅ Close and reopen menu manually
3. ✅ Check if deletion actually succeeded (server console)
4. ✅ Restart resource if persistent

### ❓ FAQ



<details>

<summary><strong>Does deleting a pet notify the owner?</strong></summary>

**No.** Deletion is silent from owner's perspective.

**Best Practice:**

1. Message owner in-game first
2. Explain why deletion is needed
3. Wait for response if possible
4. Delete after confirmation

**Exception:** Banned players or abandoned pets (no notification needed)

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What happens to pet inventory when deleted?</strong></summary>

**Automatically cleaned up!**

Pet Manager deletes:

* ✅ Pet entry (`cdev_pets` table)
* ✅ Pet inventory (`cdev_pets_inventory` table)
* ✅ All related data

Owner keeps:

* ✅ Their player data
* ✅ Other pets (if they have multiple)
* ✅ Money/items (unaffected)

**No manual cleanup needed** - it's all automatic!

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I recover a deleted pet?</strong></summary>

**No.** Deletion is **permanent and irreversible**.

**No recovery method:**

* ❌ No "undo" button
* ❌ No backup restore (unless you have database backups)
* ❌ No way to restore stats/inventory

**Prevention:**

* Always double-check before confirming
* Verify pet ID matches what you want to delete
* Consider if deletion is truly necessary

**Alternative:** If unsure, take note of pet stats before deletion so owner can recreate similar pet

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can players see Pet Manager?</strong></summary>

**No.** Only admins with `PermPetManager` permission can access it.

**Regular players:**

* ❌ Command does nothing
* ❌ Can't open menu
* ❌ Can't view database

**This prevents:**

* Players deleting others' pets
* Unauthorized database access
* Privacy violations

**Players manage their own pets via:** `/petbag` command only

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How do I find a specific pet quickly?</strong></summary>

**Method 1: Search by Owner (Fastest)**

/petmanager → \[Owner Name] → \[Pet Name]

**Method 2: Search by ID**

/petmanager → All Pets → Look for (ID: X)

**Method 3: Scroll and Search**

/petmanager → All Pets → Scroll through list

**Pro Tip:** If you know the owner, use Method 1 - much faster than scrolling through all pets!

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Does Pet Manager show spawned pets only?</strong></summary>

**No.** Pet Manager shows **ALL pets in the database**, regardless of spawn status.

**You'll see:**

* ✅ Spawned pets (currently active)
* ✅ Pets in bags (not spawned)
* ✅ Dead pets
* ✅ Abandoned pets
* ✅ Pets on treatment tables

**Status indicators:**

* Health 0% = Dead pet
* Owner "Unknown" = Likely abandoned
* Multiple pets per owner = Normal

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I edit pet stats instead of deleting?</strong></summary>

**Not directly in Pet Manager.** It's a view/delete only tool.

**To edit pet stats:**

**Option 1: Database (Recommended)**

UPDATE cdev\_pets SET health = 100, hunger = 100, thirst = 100 WHERE id = \[pet\_id];

**Option 2: Player Actions**

* Owner feeds/waters pet
* Veterinarian treats pet
* Pet naturally regenerates

**Why no editing in Pet Manager?**

* Prevents accidental stat changes
* Encourages in-game roleplay solutions
* Keeps admin tool simple and focused

**Future Feature:** Stat editing might be added in future updates!
