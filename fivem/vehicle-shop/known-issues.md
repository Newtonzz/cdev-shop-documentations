## I can't target any "tablet" or "management" prop after creating a shop

If you are using qb-target please make sure to update it to the latest version in their [GitHub](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-target). You need to click on the green button "Code" and then click on "Download ZIP" since their latest release tag doesn't seem to be updated as of now. The minimum recommended version is `5.4.0`
