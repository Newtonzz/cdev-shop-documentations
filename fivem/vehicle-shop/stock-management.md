## Deposit money

You will need to deposit money into the company's vault before you can start buying vehicles, you can do that by interacting with any **Management** prop you've set and choosing the option "**Company Vault**"

## Buy Vehicles

You can buy vehicles in the stock browser by interacting with any **Management** prop you've set and choosing the option "**Manage Stock**".

Vehicles are available to buy in the **ORDER** tab from the stock browser.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All initial vehicles are obtained from your framework's configuration (Currently supported ESX and QBCore)

If you use a custom framework you will need to add those vehicles yourself through the creator menu. [Read More](vehicle-supply.md).
