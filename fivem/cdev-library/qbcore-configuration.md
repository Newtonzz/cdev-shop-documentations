# QBCore Configuration

In order to edit optional configuration for QBCore you simply have to edit the following file:

```
cdev_lib/public/config/qbcore/qbcore_config.lua
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can modify all config properties inside the PublicQBCoreConfig table.

Each property has its own description so you can understand what it does.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Unless you have modified core aspects of your framework you don't have to worry about most of the configuration in this file.
{% endhint %}
