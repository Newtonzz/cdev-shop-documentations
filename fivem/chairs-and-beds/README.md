# ü™ë Chairs & Beds

### START HERE

1. Unzip the `cdev-chairs.zip` folder and place this folder in your servers resource folder.
2. Add the resource to your server start config: `ensure cdev-chairs` (if you are using a framework it must be placed anywhere below your framework resource eg., es\_extended, not above).
3. **WARNING** Do not edit the encrypted files in any way.

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is this resource?**

This resource is designed specifically for [Gabz Maps](https://www.gabzv.com/). Chairs and beds for every Gabz interior come pre-configured. The priority when creating this resource was to be as user friendly as possible.

## INSTALLATION GUIDE&#x20;

### Step 1 - Configure the resource

{% hint style="danger" %}
You **MUST** read all of the configurable options inside the **`config.lua`** and configure them to suit your server's needs. Please read the ‚Äùcommented out help text‚Äù at the end of each line so you can understand what each config option does.

**The most important section is the options under the Important section at the top of the `config.lua`. Everything else is optional.**
{% endhint %}

### Step 2 - Configure your keybinds

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before starting this resource on your main/live server we highly advise you to configure your keybinds because this resource uses [Fivem's Key Mapping](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/controls/).&#x20;
